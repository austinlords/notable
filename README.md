# Notable: A simple note-taking web application

## Built with React.js -> Node.js (Express) -> MongoDB

Currently in production.

This web app will allow you to create rich-text notes. Your entire library will be instantly searchable by keyword and can be filtered by tags, topics, or medium.

Instructions for use will be uploaded when project is deployed.

Cheers,
Austin
