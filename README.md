# Notable: A note-taking web application (2019)

This was the largest project I ever completed before landing my first software developer job! 

*Update 2023: No updates has been made on the project since early 2020. Recently, Heroku shut down and deleted the back-end (lack of use), but you can still view the front-end!*

---

## Built with React.js

Full-stack application is complete! This repository is the front-end only. You can find the back-end repository here: https://github.com/austinlords/notable-nodejs. 

This web app will allow you to create rich-text notes. Add tags and collections to your notes for easy filtering. Your entire library is instantly searchable. 

You can view a live demo of the web app with dummy-data here: https://www.austinlords.com/notable. You can also login/register to create and save your own notes!

Here is a sneak peak at front-end (demo version):
