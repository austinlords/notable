# Notable: A full-feature note-taking web application

## Built with React.js

Front-end is now beta-testing! You can view a live demo of the web app with dummy-data here: https://www.austinlords.com/notable-react. 

This web app will allow you to create rich-text notes. Your entire library will be instantly searchable and can be filtered by collections or tags.

Any and all feedback is welcome.

Cheers,
Austin
